# Pexels

Pexels image API service wrapper.

**Main Files:**
- `pexels_service.py` - Pexels API client

**What it does:**
- Fetches car images from Pexels
- Searches for images based on car make/model
- Returns image URLs for car listings
- Note that the results are not accurate, but we have found no other way to get pictures by following copyright laws. 
- Our team had the option to simply copy from the original webscraping website, but I think its better to try avoiding breaking copyright laws.
